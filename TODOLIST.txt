If you want a really fast Drupal 8:

 * Drupal\Core\KeyValueStore\DatabaseStorage
   Notes:
     - Easy one.
     - Must be able to separate it from the sharded pool since it needs to
       be reliable and consistent over time. The client/server pool
       implementation from 7.x-3.x must be port too.

 * Drupal\Core\Routing
   Notes:
     - Quite easy one too
     - I'm not sure if there is other components using it or not, case in
       which this is not sure anymore this is easy.

 * Drupal\Core\Config\DatabaseStorage
   Note:
     - Easy one.

 * Drupal\Core\Path\AliasStorage
   Note:
     - Already done in 7.x-2.x version, and if the schema didn't change much
       this a rather easy one too.
     - If the same schema is used that the 7.x version, then there is no use
       in sharding it, and should be stored along the router table replacement.

 * Drupal\Core\Session\SessionHandler
   Note:
     - Easy one.

The first two will get rid of almost 30 out of the 50 remaining SQL queries
on a simple homepage with no content displayed. The third one will get rid of
5 or so remaining.

If all of those are took care of, it will remain less than 10 SQL queries on
a standard profile home page. After that, real profiling needs to be done over
a site with contents, blocks and views all around the place, on various pages.
